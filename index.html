<h1>Lise's Letter to the President</h1>
<p>Dear Lise, <br>
Yesterday I saw a letter you wrote to the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama. It made me very happy to see this, because it reminded me of the time that I spent in 2008 campaigning for Obama during my last year at Michigan State. Like you mentioned being yourself in the letter, we were all very energized while working to help people in the nation. Or "pay it forward". :)<br> 
I thought I would provide you with some of the pictures that I have from it and let you know that it can sometimes be tough to make things better, but if you know it in your heart then it is worth it.<br>
Love your big brother,<br>
Craig</p>
